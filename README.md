# Tic-Tac-Toe

- Tic tac toe game that runs in a browser.
- The game is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Built for an exercise in the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript).

## Post-Finish Thoughts

- Unhappy with the production schedule. Could've finished it a lot sooner.
- If I had written more simple Javascript from the start I wouldn't have had to rewrite so much.
- This project made me a true believer in the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle.
